**This package gives you a set of conventions to make the most out of [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) in Laravel** (inspired by the [turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails) gem). There is a [companion application](https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-demo-app) that shows how to use the package and its conventions in your application.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

You may install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require tonysm/turbo-laravel
```

You may publish the asset files with:

```bash
php artisan turbo:install
```

You may also use Turbo Laravel with Jetstream if you use the Livewire stack. If you want to do so, you may want to publish the assets using the `--jet` flag:

```bash
php artisan turbo:install --jet
```

The *turbo:install* command will require and publish a couple JS files to your application. By default, it will add `@hotwired/turbo` to your `package.json` file and publish another custom HTML tag to integrate Turbo with Laravel Echo. With the `--jet` flag, it will also add a couple bridge libs needed to make sure you can use Hotwire with Jetstream, these are:

* [Alpine Turbo Bridge](https://github.com/SimoTod/alpine-turbo-drive-adapter), needed so Alpine.js works nicely; and
* [Livewire Turbo Plugin](https://github.com/livewire/turbolinks) needed so Livewire works nicely. This one will be added to your Jetstream layouts as script tags fetching from a CDN (both `app.blade.php` and `guest.blade.php`)

You may also optionally install Stimulus on top of this all by passing `--stimulus` flag to the `turbo:install` command. It's optional because we can either use Alpine.js or Stimulus (or both /shrug):

```bash
php artisan turbo:install --jet --stimulus
```

The package ships with a middleware that applies some conventions on your redirects, specially around how failed validations are redirected automatically by Laravel. To read more about this, check out the [Conventions](./docs/CONVENTIONS.md#conventions) section documentation. You may add the middleware to the "web" route group on your HTTP Kernel, like so:

```php

namespace App\Http;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel as HttpKernel;

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        'web' => [
            // ...
            \Tonysm\TurboLaravel\Http\Middleware\TurboMiddleware::class,
        ],
    ];
}
```

Keep reading the documentation to have a full picture on how you can make the most out of the technique.

## Documentation

It's highly recommended reading the [Turbo Handbook](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/). Out of everything Turbo provides, it's the Turbo Streams that benefits the most from a tight integration with Laravel. We can generate [Turbo Stream](docs/GUIDE.md#turbo-streams) from your models and either [return them from HTTP responses](docs/GUIDE.md#turbo-stream-request-macro) or *broadcast* your model changes to all users over [WebSockets using Laravel Echo](docs/GUIDE.md#turbo-streams-and-laravel-echo).

Checkout the documentation to see everything that is possible and then try the package.

### Closing Notes

Try the package out. Use your Browser's DevTools to inspect the responses. You will be able to spot every single Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream happening.
